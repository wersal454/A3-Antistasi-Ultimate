    Returns a weighted ground support vehicle pool based on war level and side

Arguments:
    <SIDE> The side for which the vehicle pool should be generated (occupants or invaders)
    <INTEGER> 1-10 range, war-level based vehicle quality

Return value:
    <ARRAY> [vehType, weight, vehType2, weight2, ...]
